Hello and welcome to the wonderful world of Tim.

Before we get started I'd like to thank Tommy for bringing me this far.

Couple of goals I have for this page:
*Set up a decent HTML/CSS splash page.
*Perform simple tasks in JavaScript.
*Demonstrate an understand of what JQuery is.

Welcome to school life buddy. I bet you didn't expect to be back at UCI this year did ya? Welcome home :)
